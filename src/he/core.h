 * Out of the box, Unity doesn't allow us to mock intra-module function calls.
 * This is generally OK but is *very* annoying for the packet lifecycle functions,
 * where we pass control to a bunch of various functions in a pipeline, so
 * instead of artificially breaking these functions into different modules we
 * just mock the "handover" here with a dispatch macro.
 *
 * If TEST isn't defined this just compiles down to a function call, so there's
 * zero performance penalty AND we would get compile errors if the function is
 * called incorrectly.
